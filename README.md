## Hi there, welcome to my GitHub.ðŸ‘‹
Recent [Business Analytics](https://sunwayuniversity.edu.my/sunway-business-school/courses/bachelor-of-business-analytics-honours) graduate from Sunway University with a knack for turning data into actionable insights. My academic journey culminated in a cutting-edge [capstone project](https://github.com/danielchung22/CapstoneProject) where I aided in the development of a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) system for bibliometric data retrieval from the website [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/home.uri). I am passionate about learning new things and expanding my capabilities.
